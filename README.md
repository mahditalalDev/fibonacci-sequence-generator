# Fibonacci Sequence Generator 🔢

Welcome to the **Fibonacci Sequence Generator**! This simple Python program generates the first `n` numbers in the Fibonacci sequence, based on user input. It’s a great exercise to learn about sequences and recursion, and explore the timeless mathematical beauty of the Fibonacci sequence.

## 📜 About the Fibonacci Sequence

The Fibonacci sequence is a famous sequence in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. The sequence is often found in nature, art, and architecture, and is defined as follows:

- **First few numbers**: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, …
- **Mathematical formula**: `F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)`, where `F(0) = 0` and `F(1) = 1`.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project is a simple command-line program that:
1. Prompts the user to enter a positive integer, `n`.
2. Generates the first `n` Fibonacci numbers.
3. Prints the sequence up to the `n`th number.
