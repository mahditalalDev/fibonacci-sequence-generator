# Fibonacci Sequence Generator 🔢

Welcome to the **Fibonacci Sequence Generator**! This Python program offers two different implementations for generating the Fibonacci sequence based on user input, making it a valuable exercise for learning about loops, sequences, and the mathematical beauty of the Fibonacci series.

## 📜 About the Fibonacci Sequence

The Fibonacci sequence is a famous series in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. Often found in nature, art, and architecture, it is defined as:

- **First few numbers**: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, …
- **Mathematical formula**: `F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)`, where `F(0) = 0` and `F(1) = 1`.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project provides two Python scripts:
1. **fibonacci_with_list.py** - Generates the Fibonacci sequence up to `n` terms, storing each term in a list.
2. **fibonacci_without_list.py** - Generates the Fibonacci sequence up to `n` terms without using a list, printing each term individually.

Both scripts prompt the user to enter a positive integer `n` to generate the first `n` Fibonacci numbers.

## 📥 Installation & Usage

Follow these steps to get started with the Fibonacci Sequence Generator:

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mahditalaldev/fibonacci-sequence-generator.git
   cd fibonacci-sequence-generator
   ```

2. **Run the Program**  
   Choose one of the files to run:

   - For the list-based approach:
     ```bash
     python fibonacci_with_list.py
     ```
   - For the non-list approach:
     ```bash
     python fibonacci_without_list.py
     ```

3. **Enter a Value for `n`**  
   When prompted, enter a positive integer. The program will display the first `n` Fibonacci numbers.

## 👨‍💻 Example Usage

Example with the list-based approach:

```bash
Enter the number of Fibonacci terms to generate: 10
Fibonacci Sequence: [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]
```

Example with the non-list approach:

```bash
Enter the number of Fibonacci terms to generate: 10
0
1
1
2
3
5
8
13
21
34
```

## 🌟 Features

- **Two Approaches**: Choose between using a list to store the sequence or printing terms directly.
- **User Input**: Specify the number `n` to generate the Fibonacci sequence up to the desired term.
- **Beginner-Friendly**: Perfect for learners exploring loops and sequences.
